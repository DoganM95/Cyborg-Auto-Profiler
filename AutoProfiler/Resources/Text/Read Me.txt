----Description----

Cyborg Auto-Profiler is a lightweight, yet reliable utility designed to switch profiles for Cyborg input devices.

When the application detects that a set game or application is running, it will change the profile accordingly. or you can set Hot Keys to switch to a specific profile. You can also set a default profile, which is activated when no set processes are detected. For R.A.T Mouse users it can change the DPI mode and Precision Aim Percentages with every individual profile allowing seamless transition and ultimate personalization. M.M.O.7 users can also change the LED colors with specific profiles.


--- Features include----

• Supports all Saitek, Cyborg, and MadCatz devices.
• Automatic switching of profiles when a specific software, or game is detected.
• Default Profile for devices when no set software, or game is detected.
• Hot Keys for swapping to specific profiles.
• You can choose from 3 types of Software detection.
• Change the DPI mode and Precision Aim settings for each profile for R.A.T devices.
• Change the LED colors or make them Flow for M.M.O.7 device for each profile.
• Launch profiles without ProfilerU Software running.
• Automatic Update option.
• Run scripts when profiles are activated and deactivated.

--- Adding Profiles----

First thing is to setup the settings for your profiles by going into the 'Profiles Settings' menu then just select 'Add Profile' and select the profile you would like to associate a process with. 



--- Adding Processes----

After adding a profile select the profile and set a process or processes That you would like to associate with the profile to trigger to switch the devices profile. You can add processes with the following options.


----Manual Input----
This option requires you to simply type the name of the process you would like to add 


----Select Executable----
This option allows you to browse your computer to find a specific Executable file and add it to the process list.


----Select from Process List----
This option will show you a list of processes and let you select witch one you would like to add.


--- Advanced Input----
 This option allows you to set a process to only be detected if the Title of the process window is what you set it to. You can select the Process and Process Window Title manually, Or you can click a process on the list and it will list the active window titles associated with it. You can also drag the window icon onto another window and select it. Keep in mind for some reason the software can only detect 1 browser title at a time, so it will only detect the last window you had active.


----Drag and Drop----
This option allows you to directly drag an executable or shortcut file into the process list. You can select as many files as you would like.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


That covers the profile and process adding. Now here are some extra option you may like to use.


----Default Profile----
If you would like to use a profile when no processes from any profiles are detected select 'Default' and it will load this profile, 
e.g. If you have a profile that is made for your desktop select default so it will return to that profile when your not 
running any specific software or games. 


----Lock profile until process ends----
This setting will make it so that the profile will not change until the process that has triggered the profile has ended.


----Priorities----
If using Process detection mode the profile chosen is prioritized in the order they are created in the Profiles list. You can move the profiles up and down the list to change priority. The Default profile has no priority effect.


----BSoD Protection----
The Saitek device drivers were not designed to change profile automatically, so when this happens an error occurs in the drivers that causes the system
to crash(BSoD). This setting will inform you in the Profile Settings menu that the profile you have selected may need to have a 
delay when switching, if selected the profile will not change until no keys have been pressed within the longest macro time in the profile. This will prevent
users getting the dreaded BSoD.


--- Rename a profile----
To rename a profile right click it on the Profiles list and select 'Rename profile' This will rename the profiles actual file also.



----------------------------Miscellaneous Settings------------------------------------------------------


----Hot Key----
You can set a Hot Key for the profile so you can switch to the set profile even if the Cyborg Auto-Profiler is disabled. But the Hot Key feature must be enabled in the setting or system tray right click menu. You can set single keys or a combination of a Modifier key(Shift, Alt, Control) with any other keys. With this feature you technically could change profiles with your Cyborg device itself.


----Lock Keys----
You can disable or enable Lock Keys with these options.


----Mouse Speed----
This Setting Modifies the system setting for the Mouses Speed. This allows you to allow certain profiles to either slow down or speed up mouse movement. If a profile modifies the mouse speed then changes to a profile that does not modify the mouse speed the mouse speed will return to the default speed that the software detects when it launched.


----Scripts----
This setting is for if you would like the profile to trigger a script when it is activated or deactivated. See 'How to use scripting' in this read-me for more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  ///////////////////////////////////////
 //  R.A.T & M.M.O.7 Custom Settings  //
///////////////////////////////////////

If you are an R.A.T or M.M.O.7 Mouse user you can change extra settings for your mouse.

R.A.T & M.M.O.7 users can select a DPI mode to change to with specific profiles. They can also change the Precision Aim Percentages.


M.M.O.7 users can set the Left and Right LED colors or make the LEDs flow to colors for specific profiles allowing further customization.



  ////////////////
 //  DPI Mode  //
////////////////

you can select a profile to change the DPI mode by setting if and what DPI Mode you would like the profile to to activate. The mouse will change the DPI mode when the profile is activated.



  /////////////////////////////////
 //  Precision Aim Percentages  //
/////////////////////////////////

You can now set Precision Aim Percentages to change with a specific profile, this also allows you to independently change the X and Y percentages to allow deeper customization. 



  //////////////////
 //  Change LED  //
//////////////////

M.M.O.7 users can select a profile to have a change the LED by checking the checkbox 'Change LED' and then pick a color. The mouse will change the LED color when the profile is activated.



  //////////////////////
 //  Color Flow LED  //
//////////////////////

M.M.O.7 user can make the LEDs flow to colors with 2-10 user set colors. 

• Flow Interval is the amount of milliseconds that need to pass for each color change in the flow. 

• Color Delay is for how many seconds are waited after reaching a set color before flowing to the next color. 

• Random Order will make the next color picked randomly from the 2-10. If Random Order is not enabled they will flow in the order set by the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  /////////////////////////////////////
 // Cyborg Auto-Profiler Settings  ///
/////////////////////////////////////


That covers the Profiles Settings area now here is the software general settings.


----Detection Type----

This setting is for the type of detection you would like profile to swap with


• Active Window Detection(Recommended)
This mode swaps profiles depending on your current active window associated with a process. This is great for swapping between programs quickly.

• Process Detection
This mode simply selects profiles by if the set process is running and works through priority on the Profiles list.

• Cursor Detection
This mode will change the profiles by the software the mouses cursor is over.


----Profiles Directory----

This setting should be the folder your profiles are located. It is usually 'C:\Users\Public\Documents\SmartTechnology Profiles' This is where it needs to load the profiles.
Older versions of the SST Programmer profile folder is located at 'C:\Users\Public\Documents\Saitek SD6 Profiles'



--- Check for Updates ----
This setting will enable/disable the Automatic Update Feature. If Automatic Updates are enabled when the software is launched it will check online for a new version. If a new version is detected it will ask the user if they would like to update and list the changes in the new version. If you select 'Yes' the software will download the new version and restart the software as the new version. If you have this Software located in a folder such as 'Program Files' that requires Administrator access you will need to launch this Software as an Administrator.




--- RAT Remember DPI Mode----
This setting makes it so if you change the DPI mode while using a profile it will remember the change and keep it if it swaps back to the profile.



----Hot Key Enabled----
This is the control setting for the Hot Key feature. Simply check this box if you would like to enable this feature.



--- Check Interval----

This setting is for how often you would like to check the current processes for a profile in milliseconds 1-30000



----Start with Windows----

This creates sets a Registry key to tell windows to run this software when it starts.



----Enable at Startup----

This setting enables the program when ever it is opened.



---Show Profile Change in System tray----

This setting effects if you would like the System tray icon to show a message when the profile is changed.


--------------------------------------------Scripting--------------------------------------

  ////////////////////////////
 // How to use scripting  ///
////////////////////////////

Cyborg Auto-Profiler only support VBScripts for now. When using the scripts there is 2 subs that can be called from this software. The first is 'Sub LoadProfile' This sub is
Called when the software activates the profile that is triggered. The other sub is 'Sub UnloadProfile' This is called when the software changes the active profile to a new one.
You do not have to have both subs for any script, just what you are using. You will need to place any scripts you make in the Cyborg Auto-Profiler Scripts folder.
You can use Notepad to make these script or you can use any VBScript editor available. I personally use Vbsedit. If using notepad make sure to save it as a '.vbs' extension.

The software will include example scripts in the Cyborg Auto-Profiler Scripts folder. You can Google online for help on how to do lots of task with these scripts. They are fairly easy to make.
If you need help trying to make a script for anything please feel free to contact me at my support E-mail and I'll do my best to help you.
