# Cyborg-Auto-Profiler
## This Source Code is forked from Danny Hasley @ Sourceforge.
### As he discontinued his work on the Cyborg-Auto-Profiler, i am planning to continue his work if i find some spare time.


## Original Software description by Danny:
>Cyborg Auto-Profiler Overview
>Automatic Profile Switching for MadCatz/Cyborg Devices
>
>Cyborg Auto-Profiler is designed to switch profiles for Cyborg input devices.
>
>When the application detects that a set game or application is running, it will change the profile accordingly. or you can set HotKeys to >switch to a specific profile. You can also set a default profile, which is activated when no set processes are detected. For R.A.T Mouse >users it can change the DPI mode and Precision Aim Percentages with every individual profile allowing seamless transition and ultimate >personalization. M.M.O.7 users can also change the LED colors with specific profiles.
